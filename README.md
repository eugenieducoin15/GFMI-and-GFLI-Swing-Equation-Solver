# SwingEquation
MUST BE RUN IN MATLAB R2021b

Code to solve the GFMI and GFLI swing equations [1,2] to find the local frequency trajectories after a load change.
Set the network, IBR and event parameters in parameters.m
Then run user_main.m

Cases from [3] have been run and data is readily available in .mat files
To view these simulations, select the option and case number in user_main.m
